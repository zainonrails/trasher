# Trasher

A gem to provide soft delete feature for rails application by using deleted_at and deleted_by 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trasher'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trasher

## Usage

```ruby
 # include this in any ActiveRecord based model that you want to soft delete. 
 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   include Trasher

   # the rest of your model code...
 end
```

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   include Trasher
   # call this method if you want set a predefined default scope. 
   lets_trash default_scope: true

   # the rest of your model code...
 end
```

To work properly, the tables that back these models must have a deleted_at timestamp column and deleted_by_id integer columns.
A `MissingColumn` exception is raised if the model does not have required columns.
 
```ruby
class AddDeletedAtColumnToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration

  def change
    add_column :users, :deleted_at, :datetime
    add_reference :users, :deleted_by, foreign_key: { to_table: :users }
  end

end
```
 
```ruby
 user1 = User.create(name: 'Name', email: 'name@whois.com')
 user2 = User.create(name: 'AnotherName', email: 'anothername@whois.com')

 # to trash/ soft delete some record. User/Post/Comment
 user1.trash!(user2)
 # this will update deleted_at and deleted_by_id attributes of user model to current timestamp and user id.

 # the trash! method raises an TrashedWithoutTrashedBy exception if a user object is not specified
 # this could be provided through current user method if using devise gem
 
 # to recover any trashed object, simply use
 user1.recover! 
 # this will update deleted_at and deleted_by_id attributes of user model to nil.
```
